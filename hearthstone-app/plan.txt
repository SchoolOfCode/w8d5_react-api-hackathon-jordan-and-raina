Step 1:  
-   Decide on an API to use  - Hearthstone 
-   Create react app and install dependencies
    -   express (for server routes)  - DON'T NEED 
    -   nodemon (for instant refreshing of server and troubleshooting) - DON'T NEED  
    -   react (obviously) 

Step 2: What we want to build

Hearthstone API

-   Get cards by
    -   Class 👍
    -   Race
